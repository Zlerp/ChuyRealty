            Welcome, my name is Hubert Chuy and I am a Real Estate Broker and also also a Staff Sargent in the U.S. Army 82nd Airborne Div. stationed in Fort Bragg. I am a Cuban-American and grew up in Miami, Florida where I am also licensed as a real estate broker. I started my first business in 2003, Creative Business Group LLC., where I practiced the home buying and selling process through two economic depressions and a couple of hurricanes. Additionally, I worked as an independent agent for Keyes Realty Company where I had the opportunity to learn all the ins and outs of what makes a home suitable for optimal comfort and safety whilst holding up as value as a solid investment even in today's market. After spending some time living in Europe, my wife and I decided that North Carolina would be the best place to raise our family.
